        I've been building and refacing cabinets for over 15 years. I can just look at a peice of wood come up with an idea for it. As you can see by my hickory chair and music sheet stand. I can also re do your current cabinets without replacing them. I can stain or paint them. So you will have a brand new kitchen just by using your old cabinets. I have also built new cabinets too if you would like to just replace them all. Everything new is all hand made. I have my own shop where I can build cabinet doors and cabinets.
